# Fast and Slow Pointers

The Fast and Slow Pointers technique, also known as the Tortoise and Hare algorithm, is a powerful approach to solve problems involving cyclic data structures, such as linked lists. The idea is to use two pointers that move at different speeds to detect cycles or find the middle of a data structure.

## General Steps
### Initialize Two Pointers:
Define two pointers:
- `slow` pointer that moves one step at a time.
- `fast` pointer that moves two steps at a time.

### Move the Pointers:
- Move the `slow` pointer by one step.
- Move the `fast` pointer by two steps.

### Detect Cycle or Find Middle:
- If there is a cycle, the `fast` pointer will eventually meet the `slow` pointer.
- If there is no cycle, the `fast` pointer will reach the end of the data structure.
- To find the middle, continue moving until the `fast` pointer reaches the end.

## Generic Pseudocode

```plaintext
function fastAndSlowPointers(head):
    slow = head
    fast = head

    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next

        if slow == fast:
            return True  // Cycle detected

    return False  // No cycle
```

## Variants of Fast and Slow Pointers

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Cycle Detection (Floyd‚Äôs Tortoise and Hare)
**Use Case:** Detecting cycles in a linked list.  
**Movement:** `slow` moves one step, `fast` moves two steps.

**Pseudocode:**
```plaintext
slow = head
fast = head

while fast and fast.next:
    slow = slow.next
    fast = fast.next.next

    if slow == fast:
        return True  // Cycle detected

return False  // No cycle
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Finding Middle of Linked List
**Use Case:** Finding the middle element of a linked list.  
**Movement:** `slow` moves one step, `fast` moves two steps.

**Pseudocode:**
```plaintext
slow = head
fast = head

while fast and fast.next:
    slow = slow.next
    fast = fast.next.next

return slow  // Middle node
```
